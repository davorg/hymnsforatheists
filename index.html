        A celebration of reason, doubt, and the extraordinary poetry of reality

        In an age where the stars are no longer gods but gateways, and truth is measured in data not doctrine, this collection offers something gloriously rare: sacred music without the superstition.
        <br />
        These twelve original hymns are for the heretics, the humanists, the skeptics and stargazers — anyone who finds transcendence not in prayer, but in particle physics.
        <br />
        Let the choir sing not of heaven, but of hydrogen. Let the organ swell not for faith, but for facts. Let us gather — not in worship — but in wonder.

      <p class="mb-2">
        Conceived in a caffeine-fuelled thought spiral by the <strong>Institute for Secular Harmony</strong>, Hymns for Atheists was composed in the great tradition of music that lifts hearts without bending knees.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        Music composed and arranged by <strong>Dr. Thea Nonbeliever</strong>, former choirmaster of the Royal Humanist Society and winner of the 2023 Dawkins Prize for Secular Sacred Composition.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        Lyrics written by <strong>Rev. A. Posteriori</strong>, who was defrocked from three imaginary religions before finding their true calling in logic, libretti, and large amounts of tea.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        Audio generated by voices not heard in churches. Website built on a solid foundation of HTML, CSS, and unshakable skepticism.
